## Company
##### To start using BigManage, you’ll need to create or join a company. This will be the main space where all your future content is organized and managed.
### Creating your first company
> Creating your first company on BigManage is simple and seamless. As you input your initial data, the system automatically sets up your company for you and guides you through each step, so you don’t need to worry about this part.
### Creating more companies
> Create a new company by specifying its name. For example, you could tell BigManage: “Create a company named HorizonTech” or “Add a new company called Stellar Innovations.”
### Changing between the companies you are part of
> Switch from one company you own to another by specifying the company’s name or ID. For example, you could tell BigManage: “Switch to company AlphaCorp” or “Change active company to ID 42.”
### Transfering a company you own
> Transfer ownership of the company to another employee by specifying their employee ID, name, or email. You can optionally provide a justification and include the verification code sent to the current owner’s email. For example, you could tell BigManage: “Transfer company ownership to John” or “Assign ownership to jane.smith@example.com with justification: leaving the company.”
### Renaming the company
> Change the name of your company by specifying the new name. You can refer to the company by its current name or ID if needed. For example, you could tell BigManage: “Rename the company to ‘NextGen Solutions’” or “Change my team’s name to ‘Innovators Inc.’”

## Employees
##### Each company on BigManage is made up of employees who use it regularly to manage their work. Employees may be notified on the last platform they used, depending on the action of another employee.
### Adding employees to the company
> Add a new employee to your company by providing their email address. BigManage will find or create the employee based on the email. For example, you could tell BigManage: “Add a new employee with email john.doe@example.com” or “Invite sara.smith@example.com to join the company”.

### Removing employees from the company

## Positions
##### Employees can have no position, a single position or multiple positions, which define their role and level in the company’s hierarchy.

## Timezone
##### The timezone determines how time is calculated for each employee, making it easy to track events and answer questions like ‘How long ago did this happen?’
### Changing your timezone
> Provide the timezone you want to set using its abbreviation (e.g., “EET”, “PST”) or by naming a city or country in that timezone (e.g., “Athens”, “New York”). For example, you could tell BigManage: “Set my timezone to EET” or “Set my timezone to Athens.”

## Preferred Language
