## Company
##### To start using BigManage, you’ll need to create or join a company. This will be the main space where all your future content is organized and managed.
### Creating your first company
> Creating your first company on BigManage is simple and seamless. As you input your initial data, the system automatically sets up your company for you and guides you through each step, so you don’t need to worry about this part.
### Creating more companies
> Create a new company by specifying its name. For example, you could tell BigManage: “Create a company named HorizonTech” or “Add a new company called Stellar Innovations.”
### Changing between the companies you are part of
> Switch from one company you own to another by specifying the company’s name or ID. For example, you could tell BigManage: “Switch to company AlphaCorp” or “Change active company to ID 42.”

## Employees
##### Each company on BigManage is made up of employees who use it regularly to manage their work. Employees may be notified on the last platform they used, depending on the action of another employee.
### Adding employees to the company
